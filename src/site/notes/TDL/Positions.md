| **Affirmative Action**               | I believe affirmative action was appropriate for a time. and was probably implemented for longer than it was useful to address the inequities it was meant to.                                                   |
| **Diversity**                        | Diversity is not a virtue. from my perspective Diversity can be good depending on the intention and consequences.                                                                                                |
| **Global Warming**                   | Global warming is real and caused by humans. The best approach includes incentivizing greener energies and implementing carbon pricing policies.                                                                 |

| **Immigration**                      | Immigration is a Positive Part of our history, Economy, and Society. I am In support of strong borders and feel we need to revisit our policies regarding immigration to optimize the process.                   |
| **Illegal Immigration**              | Amnesty programs like the IRCA can have benefits for workers and governments but also drawbacks that need consideration.                                                                                         |

| **Social Justice**                   | Incorporating equity into policy and law is crucial, recognizing historical disadvantages and their present-day outcomes.                                                                                        |
