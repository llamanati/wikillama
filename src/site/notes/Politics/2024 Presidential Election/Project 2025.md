Project 2025 Aims to Undermine Existing Government

- Project 2025 is a plan with a goal to completely change the U.S. federal government if a Republican wins the 2024 presidential election.
    
- The project, started in 2022, wants to bring tens of thousands of conservatives to Washington, D.C. to replace current federal government workers, who Republicans call the "deep state".
    

Project 2025 Promotes Authoritarianism and Un-American Values

- Critics label Project 2025 as an authoritarian and Christian nationalist movement, potentially leading the U.S. towards autocracy.
    
- The project's aim to replace existing civil servants with those aligned with a specific political ideology undermines democratic principles and the peaceful transfer of power.
    
- Experts argue that Project 2025 would weaken the rule of law and the separation of powers, key tenets of the American democratic system.
    
- The project's proposal to use the military for domestic law enforcement and target political opponents raises concerns about the militarization of government and the suppression of dissent.
    

Project 2025 Seeks to Undermine Established Rights and Freedoms

- Project 2025's plans to criminalize pornography, eliminate protections for sexual and gender identity, and end diversity programs directly contradict American values of freedom of expression and equal rights.
    
- The project's stance on abortion and contraception contradicts the right to privacy and bodily autonomy central to American values.
    

Project 2025 Rejects Scientific Consensus and Disregards Expertise

- Project 2025 advocates for federal funding of scientific research only if it aligns with conservative principles, potentially stifling scientific progress and innovation.
    
- The plan's proposals to dismantle or significantly alter government agencies like the FBI, DHS, EPA, FCC, and FTC based on ideology rather than expertise could jeopardize national security, environmental protection, and economic stability.
    

Concerns About Project 2025 Extend Beyond Political Affiliation

- Criticism of Project 2025 comes not only from those opposed to its ideological leanings but also from some conservatives and Republicans concerned about its potential to centralize power, harm the environment, and negatively impact foreign trade.
    
- This cross-partisan concern underscores the potential threat that Project 2025 poses to the foundational principles of American governance.
